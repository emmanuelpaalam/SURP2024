# "A Machine Learning Approach to Predicting Student Dropouts on the ELS:2002 Study" Artifacts

This repository serves as a version-controlled backup and public showcase of outputs from my summer 2024 research project conducted at The University of West Florida.
It is solely for archival purposes and the repository as a whole is not clonable for experiment reproduction of the project, which was conducted within Google Drive and Colab-hosted notebooks as 
a lightweight option. However, the raw data used for the project <a href = "https://nces.ed.gov/datalab/onlinecodebook/session/codebook/a0a4cd56-017a-4feb-8ed0-850be9ef9121">can be downloaded here</a>, 
which can then be used to run the notebooks provided in this repository.

The overall intent of this project was to explore different preprocessing methods and supervised machine learning models for the task of precise & recallable prediction of non-dropout vs dropout outcomes per 
study participant based on selected factors. XGBoost, when given data preprocessed with SMOTE and the MICE algorithm, was declared the optimal resulting model.
